# Sunset SSH

A SSH client and server implementation. It is intended to be very flexible to
embed pretty much anywhere, I'm collecting possible use cases in
[discussions](https://github.com/mkj/sunset/discussions/1). Don't hesitate to
suggest something!

- `sunset` (this toplevel) is the core SSH implementation. It provides a
  non-async API, runs with `no_std` and no alloc.

- [`sunset-async`](async) - async SSH client and server library, also
  `no_std` no-alloc. This is async-executor agnostic (using Embassy for mutexes, but works on std too).

- [`demos`](demos) has demos with Embassy executor for wifi on a Raspberry Pi
  [Pico W](demos/picow) or a
  [Linux tap device on `std`](demos/std) running locally.

  At present the Pico W build is around 150kB binary size
  (plus ~200KB [cyw43](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/main/cyw43) wifi firmware),
  using about 13kB RAM per concurrent SSH session.

- [`sunset-stdasync`](stdasync/) adds functionality to use Sunset as a normal SSH client or
  server async library in normal Rust (not `no_std`). This uses Tokio or async-std.

  The [examples](stdasync/examples) include a Linux commandline SSH client `sunsetc`. It works as a day-to-day SSH client.

## SSH Features

Working:

- Client and server
- Shell or command connection
- Password and public key authentication
- ed25519 signatures
- curve25519 key exchange
- chacha20-poly1305, aes256-ctr ciphers
- hmac-sha256 integrity
- rsa (`std`-only unless someone writes a `no_std` crate)
- `~.` client escape sequences

Desirable:

- SFTP
- TCP forwarding
- Post quantum hybrid key exchange
- A std server example
- Perhaps aes256-gcm
- Perhaps ECDSA, hardware often supports it ahead of ed25519

## Rust versions

At the time of writing Sunset will build with Rust 1.83.
The requirement may increase whenever useful, targetting stable.

## Checks

Sunset uses `forbid(unsafe)`, apart from `sunset-async` which 
requires `unsafe` for Unix interactions.

Release builds should not panic, instead returning `Error::bug()`.
`debug_assert!` is used in some places for invariants during testing or
fuzzing.

Some attempts are made to clear sensitive memory after use, but stack copies
will not be cleared.

It's built on top of lots of other work, particularly Embassy, the rust-crypto crates,
Virtue, smoltcp, and Salty.
